# SNN_attempt_t1c
This is my attempt at making an SNN

I was unfortunately unable to run the scripts and whatnot on my computer therefore I was unable to actually process the droid dataset. I had to do a good amount of research on the internet to even get up to speed on how SNNs work. Nevertheless, here is my attempt.

I wrote up some verilog to set up the SNN with a handful of nodes that would transmit data across the network when the data inputs applied exceed certain thresholds.
